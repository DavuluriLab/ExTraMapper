# ExTraMapper
ExTraMapper is a tool to find Exon and Transcript-level Mappings of a given pair of orthologous genes between two organisms using sequence conservation. The figure below shows the overall schematic description of ExTraMapper mapping the homologous transcript and exon-pairs between human and mouse genome.
