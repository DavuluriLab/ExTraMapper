This entry describes how we downloaded and processed data from:
Fu, G.C. and Lin, W.C. (2012) Identification of gene-oriented exon orthology
between human and mouse. BMC genomics, 13 Suppl 1, S10.

Typing ./runall in command line should be able to replicate all steps from
download to conversion (liftOver) of coordinates to hg38 and mm10 reference
genome versions.

NOTE: Since this paper did not report which reference genome versions they
use, I determined it by checking the numbers mentioned in "There are 16,545 
human-mouse orthologous pairs in total based on human NCBI build 36.3 on March 
26, 2008 and mouse NCBI build 37.1 on July 5, 2007 [5]." 
These numbers corresponded to hg18 for human and mm9 reference for mouse genomes.
