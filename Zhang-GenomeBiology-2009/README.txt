This entry describes how we downloaded and processed data from:
Zhang, Z., Zhou, L., Wang, P., Liu, Y., Chen, X., Hu, L. and Kong, X. (2009) Divergence of exonic splicing elements after gene duplication and the impact on gene structures. Genome biology, 10, R120. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883501

Typing ./runall in command line should be able to replicate all steps from
download to conversion (liftOver) of coordinates to hg38 and mm10 reference
genome versions.
